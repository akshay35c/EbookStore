Though marriage had been discussed between her and Giles, Grace finds herself captivated by Dr Edred Fitzpiers, a sophisticated newcomer to the area - a relationship that is encouraged by her socially ambitious father. Hardy's novel of betrayal, disillusionment and moral compromise depicts a secluded community coming to terms with the disastrous impact of outside influences. And in his portrayal of Giles Winterborne, Hardy shows a man who responds deeply to the forces of the natural world, thought they ultimately betray him.",

As soon as I could comprehend the basics of reading, this is the book I read, more than any other. The story (Talking animals! Friendly spiders!) is down-home, laugh-out-loud funny, but also charming and slighly sad, but still optimistic, at it's conclusion.",
